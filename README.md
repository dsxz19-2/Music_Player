# Music_Player
Easy way to play music (work in progress, also will be implemented into JARVIS but also works as a standalone app). It was surprisingly diffecult to get working correctly (or maybe I'm just bad who knows). I started working on it before break and left it for a while when I came back I completely forgot what I was doing lol. Got it working eventually tho.
